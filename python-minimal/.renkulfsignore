# WARNING: editing this file will impact the behavior of renku commands
# by telling renku to *not track* listed files with git LFS
#
# The syntax is the same as .gitignore (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
# see https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template for proper
# usage.

*.ipynb # Warning: removing this line will check generated ipynb files (e.g. from papermill) into LFS: they will no longer be displayed in the renku UI
