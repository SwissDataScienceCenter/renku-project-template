# WARNING : As Renku makes use of mamba for more efficient package builds, please use the popular "conda-forge" channel
# For more details : https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/troubleshooting.html#mixing-the-defaults-and-conda-forge-channels
# Using the defaults channel from Anaconda can easily result in getting your
# laptop, CI pipeline, etc. blacklisted by Anaconda which makes building packages
# impossible. To get permission to use Anaconda again you need to either pay or prove that
# you meet the requirements for a free license. Using the conda-forge channel avoids 
# these restrictions completely.
channels:
  - conda-forge
# dependencies:
# - add packages here
# - one per line
